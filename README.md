# Robotix-Friend



This major project implements a waving robot through infrared signal detection on ESP32 using the Arduino architecture. The team chose this topic because it allows the application of various learned concepts, while also creating an adorable companion always ready to wave hello whenever needed. The main functionalities include:

1. Remote Control: Users press a control button to send signals to the robot friend.
2. OLED Display: Expressing the robot's emotions on a 1.3-inch OLED screen.
3. Servo Motors: Demonstrating the waving motion of the robot's hand.
